# Student-Performance-At-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance and identifying whether a student is at risk using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
